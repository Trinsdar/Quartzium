# ProjectY

ProjectY is an attempt to reimagine the decoration blocks from 1.4.7 XyCraft. While the main focus is around decoration,
some of the functional blocks from XyCraft will be included as well, such as the Fabricator and Soil blocks.

This mod is intended to be both performant, stable, and future-proof: it uses the 1.8+ model system idiomatically and
also has fully flattened blocks, meaning it is 1.13 ready. Texture animation like in 1.4.7 has been excluded due to
performance reasons, and has been replaced with statically assembled textures at build time.
